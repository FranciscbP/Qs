# Qs
Final Year Project

Nowadays transportation and queues are a big part of our lives. In big cities, citizens spend almost a third of their lives in transportation and queues. 
It is common knowledge that people like to release the tension from their Classes, Jobs, etc.., by going out with their friends or colleagues to a Club, Restaurant or other leisure places. 
However, if there is no previous booking before going to those places or if you don't know anyone that is in that place so you can ask about the status of it, sometimes when arriving there the queue might be too long, and it might even not be possible to enter that place because of it. 
This Final Year Project aims to prevent such situations from occurring,with the development of Qâ€™s (queues) mobile application, an app that will gather and give the current state of those leisure places queues in an intuitive map.
The app will function in a similar way to the Waze app where the users are able to send reports about the status of a place in real-time when they are in the place or walking by it. 
The app will calculate the average of each report from the last hour for that specific place, and then display the current place queue status. 
This will allow other users to check the status of the place they are planning to visit before they arrive, without having to know anyone else who is there.
One of the key considerations of this app would be security between users. This means that the app will not display any data from the user who sent the report so other users don't see who is or has been on the place that was updated. 
Another key consideration is to prevent the spam of reports. To prevent this, each user can only send a report about a specific place queue status every 5 minutes.
This app was developed in a multi-platform framework called React Native which will allow a simple compilation for Android and IOS devices.
